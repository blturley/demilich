# Demilich
-alpha build 1.0

### Heroku app: https://demilich.herokuapp.com/

## Program summary:

 Demi-Lich is an easily accessible in-browser D&D character creator and organizer. Character creation in D&D can be a pain. What with having to fill out forms like in a doctor’s office and carrying it around with you, scribbling notes to keep track of your inventory and equipment. Enter Demi-Lich: An in-browser, dedicated character creator and organizer with a sleek and intuitive interface that makes character creation a breeze. Demi-Lich saves and displays created character info along with abilities, and equipment, and uses a dungeon and dragons 5th edition api to provide optional auto-population for item, weapon, spell, and skill forms. Another notable feature is the character graveyard: a place to store your dearly departed characters and all their info (including cause of death and even a custom eulogy if you so desire). If you’re an experienced D&D player, new to the game, or are even playing a different RPG altogether; Demi-Lich is highly customizable and able to tackle all of your roleplaying character needs.

## Who is Edgar Meloncamp? This is not my character.

Edgar is a placeholder character that exists before your characters are selected. If you see him it means for some reason your browser is not communicating properly with the database. If this happens make sure your connection is secure and the url has https instead of http.
